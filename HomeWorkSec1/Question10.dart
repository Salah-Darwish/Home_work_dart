/**
 * Question 10
Explain what happens if you try to use a variable before it is declared in Dart.
Answer:
In Dart, if you try to use a variable before it is declared, you will encounter a compile-time error. 
Dart is a statically typed language, which means that all variables must be declared before they are used. 
This helps catch errors early in the development process and ensures that the code is type-safe.
